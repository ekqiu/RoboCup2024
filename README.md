Welcome to Team Impeccable Jawlines' repo for the code used in 2024. We made use of ev3dev, micropython to code in Python on the EV3 Brick. 

We hope that by making this code public, we can help those who are interested in competing in RoboCup 2024. However, do not copy the code blindly. If you have any questions, do send me an email and I'll be happy to help. Thanks!
